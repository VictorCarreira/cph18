	abstract = {Because of the "all-or-none" character of nervous activity, neural events and the relations among them can be treated by means of propositional logic. It is found that the behavior of every net can be described in these terms, with the addition of more complicated logical means for nets containing circles; and that for any logical expression satisfying certain conditions, one can find a net behaving in the fashion it describes. It is shown that many particular choices among possible neurophysiological assumptions are equivalent, in the sense that for every net behaving under one assumption, there exists another net which behaves under the other and gives the same results, although perhaps not in the same time. Various applications of the calculus are discussed.},

	abstract = {Part I attempts to review the background, basic sources of data, concepts, and methodology to be employed in the study of perceptrons. In Chapter 2, a brief review of the main alternative approaches to the development of brain models is presented. Chapter 3 considers the physiological and psychological criteria for a suitable model, and attempts to evaluate the empirical evidence which is available on several important issues. Chapter 4 contains basic definitions and some of the notation to be used in later sections are presented. Parts II and III are devoted to a summary of the established theoretical results obtained to date. Part II (Chapters 5 through 14) deals with the theory of three-layer series-coupled perceptrons, on which most work has been done to date. Part III (Chapters 15 through 20) deals with the theory of multi-layer and cross-coupled perceptrons. Part IV is concerned with more speculative models and problems for future analysis. Of necessity, the final chapters become increasingly heuristic in character, as the theory of perceptrons is not yet complete, and new possibilities are continually coming to light. (Author)},

This relation leads to a new network information criterion which is useful for selecting the optimal network model based on a given training set.},

@article{Milani1998,
	abstract = {The geological development of the Parana Basin was influenced by the geodynamics of southwestern Gondwana, a domain continuously affected during almost all the Phanerozoic eon by compressional stresses derived from a persistently active convergent motion between the continental block and the oceanic lithosphere of Panthalassa. The Parana Basin was supported by a cratonic basement since its inception, but had in its neighbourhood evolving collisional belts fringed by foreland basins. Some areas were selected representing the history of subsidence along the foreland domain of southwestern Gondwana during Paleozoic times. The subsidence analysis showed that such foreland basins experienced cycles of accelerated subsidence that coincide in time with the major orogenic phases, that were related to the docking of terranes along the margin of the continent. The computation of average subsidence rates revealed the main subsidence cycles for the region as a whole. Subsidence and sediment accumulation in the Parana Basin started during Middle to Late Ordovician times when the Precordillera terrane collided against Gondwana and produced the different contractional phases of the Ocloyic Orogeny. The intraplate response to the compressional stresses related to this orogenic cycle was transtensional reactivation of weakness zones, providing the initial subsidence for the Parana Basin. Repeatedly during the geologic history of the Parana Basin orogenic cycles left their signature as periods of accelerated subsidence. Subsidence plots revealed that Early Devonian times, when the stresses generated by the Precordilleran Orogeny affected Gondwana, and Late Permian times, under the yoke of the Sanrafaelic Orogeny, were periods when intracratonic subsidence rates increased remarkably. An integrated analysis of the sedimentary record of the Parana Basin, considering eustatic variations of the sea level and subsidence cycles of southwestern Gondwana led to the conclusion that the stratigraphic cyclicity observed in the Parana Basin was ultimately influenced by its subsidence history. The presumed global correlation peaks shown in Vail's curve, of Late Silurian, Early Carboniferous and Early Permian ages, are not present in the Parana Basin. Instead, local maximum flooding levels developed in each one of the second order transgressive cycles, during Early Silurian, Early Devonian and Late Permian times, defining the particular subsidence history of this interior basin as an intraplate response to geodynamic processes affecting southwestern Gondwana margin.},

	abstract = {Delineation of bed boundaries is one of the important aspects of petrophysical interpretation. Proper location of bed boundaries plays a key role in log data inversion, especially in resistivity inversion, where the subsurface formation parameters are commonly parameterized into layers of varying thickness and resistivity. Traditionally, the location of bed boundaries is chosen based on the inflection points, maximum change in slope, etc. These algorithms work well for focussed responses and reasonably well for unfocussed responses, but the algorithms fail in presence of noise and in thin-bed regions. In order to overcome these difficulties, we propose an algorithm using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for detection of bed boundaries. We demonstrate the applicability of the algorithm on array induction data for a synthetic Oklahoma formation model and a field data from the Gulf of Mexico. The results obtained from the proposed scheme are compared with existing bed boundary algorithms},

	abstract = {In boreholes with partial or no core recovery, interpretations of lithology in the remainder of the hole are routinely attempted using data from downhole geophysical sensors. We present a practical neural net-based technique that greatly enhances lithological interpretation in holes with partial core recovery by using downhole data to train classifiers to give a global classification scheme for those parts of the borehole for which no core was retrieved. We describe the system and its underlying methods of data exploration, selection and classification, and present a typical example of the system in use. Although the technique is equally applicable to oil industry boreholes, we apply it here to an Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) borehole (Hole 792E, Izu-Bonin forearc, a mixture of volcaniclastic sandstones, conglomerates and claystones). The quantitative benefits of quality-control measures and different subsampling strategies are shown. Direct comparisons between a number of discriminant analysis methods and the use of neural networks with back-propagation of error are presented. The neural networks perform better than the discriminant analysis techniques both in terms of performance rates with test data sets (2–3 per cent better) and in qualitative correlation with non-depth-matched core. We illustrate with the Hole 792E data how vital it is to have a system that permits the number and membership of training classes to be changed as analysis proceeds. The initial classification for Hole 792E evolved from a five-class to a three-class and then to a four-class scheme with resultant classification performance rates for the back-propagation neural network method of 83, 84 and 93 per cent respectively.},

Such a concept seems to adequately justify the known petroleum provinces worldwide. The Mesozoic-Cenozoic tectono-sedimentary evolution of the Brazilian margin provided the key elements for petroleum existence. In the present day view, the deep water domain of the Campos Basin appears as the area where petroleum systems worked in a very favourable manner, being the region that presently holds most of Brazilian oil and gas reserves. The history of petroleum exploration in Brazil includes three major phases: the pre-Petrobras phase, characterized by pioneer recognition activities; the Petrobras period, when the Company worked under the monopoly regime, including the following sub-phases – 1954/1968: exploration in land, 1969/1974: shallow water activities; 1975/1984: shallow water in Campos Basin; and 1985/1997: deep water exploration; each one of these sub-phases had very peculiar characteristics, and the Brazilian petroleum reserves increased progressively during the entire phase, reaching today the amount of 16 billion barrels of oil-equivalent. Today, the Country is living under the New Regulation of the Petroleum Sector; new players came into the game, re-exploring older provinces and reaching brand new, challenging frontiers.},

	abstract = {Artificial neural systems have been used in a variety of problems in the fields of science and engineering. Here we describe a study of the applicability of neural networks to solving some geophysical inverse problems. In particular, we study the problem of obtaining formation resistivities and layer thicknesses from vertical electrical sounding (VES) data and that of obtaining 1D velocity models from seismic waveform data. We use a two-layer feedforward neural network (FNN) that is trained to predict earth models from measured data. Part of the interest in using FNNs for geophysical inversion is that they are adaptive systems that perform a non-linear mapping between two sets of data from a given domain. In both of our applications, we train FNNs using synthetic data as input to the networks and a layer parametrization of the models as the network output. The earth models used for network training are drawn from an ensemble of random models within some prespecified parameter limits. For network training we use the back-propagation algorithm and a hybrid back-propagation-simulated-annealing method for the VES and seismic inverse problems, respectively. Other fundamental issues for obtaining accurate model parameter estimates using trained FNNs are the size of the training data, the network configuration, the description of the data and the model parametrization. Our simulations indicate that FNNs, if adequately trained, produce reasonably accurate earth models when observed data are input to the FNNs.},

But evidence of an even older crust is provided by detrital zircons in metamorphosed sediments at Mt Narryer and Jack Hills in the Narryer Gneiss Terrane, Yilgarn Craton, Western Australia, where grains as old as approximately 4,276 Myr have been found. Here we report, based on a detailed micro-analytical study of Jack Hills zircons, the discovery of a detrital zircon with an age as old as 4,404+/-8 Myr--about 130 million years older than any previously identified on Earth. We found that the zircon is zoned with respect to rare earth elements and oxygen isotope ratios (delta18O values from 7.4 to 5.0{\%}), indicating that it formed from an evolving magmatic source. The evolved chemistry, high delta18O value and micro-inclusions of SiO2 are consistent with growth from a granitic melt with a delta18O value from 8.5 to 9.5{\%}. Magmatic oxygen isotope ratios in this range point toward the involvement of supracrustal material that has undergone low-temperature interaction with a liquid hydrosphere. This zircon thus represents the earliest evidence for continental crust and oceans on the Earth.},

Seven methods which can give the relative contribution and/or the contribution profile of the input factors were compared: (i) the 'PaD' (for Partial Derivatives) method consists in a calculation of the partial derivatives of the output according to the input variables; (ii) the 'Weights' method is a computation using the connection weights; (iii) the 'Perturb' method corresponds to a perturbation of the input variables; (iv) the 'Profile' method is a successive variation of one input variable while the others are kept constant at a fixed value; (v) the 'classical stepwise' method is an observation of the change in the error value when an adding (forward) or an elimination (backward) step of the input variables is operated; (vi) 'Improved stepwise a' uses the same principle as the classical stepwise, but the elimination of the input occurs when the network is trained, the connection weights corresponding to the input variable studied is also eliminated; (vii) 'Improved stepwise b' involves the network being trained and fixed step by step, one input variable at its mean value to note the consequences on the error. The data tested in this study concerns the prediction of the density of brown trout spawning redds using habitat characteristics. The PaD method was found to be the most useful as it gave the most complete results, followed by the Profile method that gave the contribution profile of the input variables. The Perturb method allowed a good classification of the input parameters as well as the Weights method that has been simplified but these two methods lack stability. Next came the two improved stepwise methods (a and b) that both gave exactly the same result but the contributions were not sufficiently expressed. Finally, the classical stepwise methods gave the poorest results. {\textcopyright} 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

The westernmost IS-type Acre Basin is interpreted as a retro arc foreland basin related to the Andean orogenesis (Jordan, 1995). Continental sediments filled a syneclisis from the Carboniferous until the Jurassic, with rocks of marine to continental environment followed by a flexure in the Cretaceous and Tertiary. East of this basin and separated from it by the Iquitos Arch, the Solim{\~{o}}es Basin is internally divided in two by the Carauari Arch. It covers some 400.000 km2 and its sedimentary fill range from the Ordovician to the Permian, grouped into three sequences. The sedimentary environment of these rocks is in general marine, with brief intervals of continental sedimentation. East of this basin, separated from it by the Pur{\'{u}}s Arch, is the IF/IS-type Amazonas Basin. Ordovician to Cretaceous rocks fill this basin, with a sedimentation environment ranging from marine to deltaic, fluvial and lacustrine. The northernmost basin of the province is the Tacutu Basin. This IF-type basin is an intracontinental rift system that straddles the border between Brazil and Guyana, covering some 4,500 km2 of the Brazilian territory. Its sedimentary fill comprises a Jurassic super-sequence that contains the pre-rift rocks such as basaltic flows and lacustrine sediments. The rift rocks are lacustrine and fluvio-deltaic sediments with conglomerates from the rift border. The basin is interpreted as an aulacogen related to the opening of the Atlantic Ocean. IS-type Cenozoic fluvial and lacustrine clastics of the Solim{\~{o}}es and Boa Vista basins were unconformably deposited above these basins.

	abstract = {Accurate interpretation of magnetotelluric (MT) data in the presence of static shift arising from near-surface inhomogeneities is an unresolved problem in three-dimensional (3-D) inversion. While it is well known in 1-D and 2-D studies that static shift can lead to erroneous interpretation, how static shift can influence the result of 3-D inversion is not fully understood and is relevant to improved subsurface analysis. Using the synthetic data generated from 3-D models with randomly distributed heterogeneous overburden and elongate homogeneous overburden that are consistent with geological observations, this paper examines the effects of near-surface inhomogeneity on the accuracy of 3-D inversion models. It is found that small-scale and shallow depth structures are severely distorted while the large-scale structure is marginally distorted in 3-D inversion not accounting for static shift; thus the erroneous near-surface structure does degrade the reconstruction of smaller-scale structure at any depth. However, 3-D joint inversion for resistivity and static shift significantly reduces the artifacts caused by static shifts and improves the overall resolution, irrespective of whether a zero-sum or Gaussian distribution of static shifts is assumed. The 3-D joint inversion approach works equally well for situations where the shallow bodies are of small size or long enough to allow some induction such that the effects of near-surface inhomogeneity are manifested as a frequency-dependent shift rather than a constant shift.},

The Guar?? Formation (Upper Jurassic) displays a well-defined facies shift along its outcrop belt. On its northern portion it is characterised by coarse-grained to conglomeratic sandstones with trough and planar cross-bedding, as well as low-angle lamination, which are interpreted to represent braided river deposits. Southwards these fluvial facies thin out and interfinger with fine- to medium-grained sandstones with large-scale cross-stratification and horizontal lamination, interpreted as eolian dune and eolian sand sheets deposits, respectively. The Botucatu Formation is characterised by large-scale cross-strata formed by successive climbing of eolian dunes, without interdune and/or fluvial accumulation (dry eolian system). The contact between the Guara and the Botucatu formations is delineated by a basin-wide deflation surface (supersurface). The abrupt change in the depositional conditions that took place across this supersurface suggests a major climate change, from semi-arid (Upper Jurassic) to hyper-arid (Lower Cretaceous) conditions. A rearrangement of the Paran?? Basin depocenters is contemporaneous to this climate change, which seems to have changed from a more restrict accumulation area in the Guara Formation to a wider sedimentary context in the Botucatu Formation.},

We have developed a new joint-inversion algorithm to estimate reservoir parameters directly, using both seismic amplitude variation with angle of incidence (AVA) data and marine controlled-source electromagnetic (CSEM) data. Reservoir parameters are linked to geophysical parameters through a rock-properties model. Errors in the parameters of the rock-properties model introduce errors of comparable size in the reservoir-parameter estimates produced by joint inversion. Tests of joint inversion on synthetic 1D models demonstrate improved fluid saturation and porosity estimates for joint AVA-CSEM data inversion (compared with estimates from AVA or CSEM inversion alone). A comparison of inversions of AVA data, CSEM data, and joint AVA-CSEM data over the North Sea Troll field, at a location for which we have well control, shows that the joint inversion produces estimates of gas saturation, oil saturation, and porosity that are closest (as measured by the rms difference, the L1 norm of the difference, and net values over the interval) to the logged values. However, CSEM-only inversion provides the closest estimates of water saturation.},

	abstract = {Although large sedimentary provinces, the South Amer- ican intracratonic basins have not been characterized yet as repositories of significant mineral and energy wealths, compared to their counterparts in the Northern Hemisphere. In the Paran{\'{a}} Basin, heart of industrialized Brazil, hydroelectric power derived from waterfalls developed on the Cretaceous basaltic cover, gemstones and rich soils both derived again from the basalts, and ground- water from Jurassic eolian sandstones are the main resources. Bituminous shales, and more recently, gas discoveries constitute secondary resources; gas seems to characterize the Argentinian Chaco-Paran{\'{a}} Basin. In the Solim{\~{o}}es Basin, the development of significant reserves of gas, and less noticeably of oil, is hampered by the remoteness of the area and lack of a nearby mar- ket. For the same reasons, in the Amazonas Basin large reserves of evaporites lie untouched in the subsurface; recent gas discoveries made near the capital jungle of Manaus point to a brighter future for their exploitation. In the Parna{\'{i}}ba Basin, situated in a remote semi-arid region of Brazil, groundwater is the main exploited min- eral resource. Considering their geological characteristics, the small amount of exploration performed in these basins is in sharp contrast with their petroleum potential. Some of their deposits have barely been scratched, suggesting that these areas may be profitable for bold investors},

	A evolu{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o geol{\'{o}}gica da Bacia do Paran{\'{a}} foi marcantemente influenciada pela geodin{\^{a}}mica do dom{\'{i}}nio sul-ocidental do Gondwana. Esta foi uma regi{\~{a}}o continuamente submetida, durante praticamente todo o Faneroz{\'{o}}ico, a esfor{\c{c}}os de natureza compressiva derivados da rela{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de converg{\^{e}}ncia mantida entre o bloco si{\'{a}}lico gondw{\^{a}}nico e a litosfera oce{\^{a}}nica do Panthalassa. A Bacia do Paran{\'{a}}, embora suportada por um embasamento crat{\^{o}}nico desde sua implanta{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o, teve em sua vizinhan{\c{c}}a ativos cintur{\~{o}}es colisionais e bacias de antepa{\'{i}}s a eles relacionadas. Algumas {\'{a}}reas foram selecionadas como representativas do comportamento da subsid{\^{e}}ncia durante o Paleoz{\'{o}}ico ao longo do dom{\'{i}}nio de antepa{\'{i}}s do Gondwana sul-ocidental. A an{\'{a}}lise de subsid{\^{e}}ncia mostrou que tais bacias de antepa{\'{i}}s experimentaram ciclos de subsid{\^{e}}ncia acelerada que coincidem temporalmente com as principais fases orog{\^{e}}nicas, estas relacionadas {\`{a}} aglutina{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de terrenos al{\'{o}}ctones ao paleocontinente. O c{\'{a}}lculo de taxas m{\'{e}}dias de subsid{\^{e}}ncia revelou os principais ciclos de subsid{\^{e}}ncia para a regi{\~{a}}o como um todo. A subsid{\^{e}}ncia e a acumula{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o sedimentar na Bacia do Paran{\'{a}} iniciaram durante o Meso a Neo-Ordoviciano, tempo em que o terreno da Precordilheira colidiu contra o Gondwana e produziu a Orogenia Ocl{\'{o}}yica. A resposta no dom{\'{i}}nio intraplaca aos esfor{\c{c}}os compressivos derivados desse ciclo orog{\^{e}}nico foi na forma de reativa{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o transtensiva de zonas de fraqueza, o que patrocinou a subsid{\^{e}}ncia inicial da Bacia do Paran{\'{a}}. Repetidamente durante sua hist{\'{o}}ria geol{\'{o}}gica, a Bacia do Paran{\'{a}} experimentou ciclos de subsid{\^{e}}ncia acelerada induzidos por epis{\'{o}}dios orog{\^{e}}nicos. A an{\'{a}}lise de subsid{\^{e}}ncia revelou que o Eodevoniano, quando os esfor{\c{c}}os gerados pela Orogenia Precordilheirana afetaram o Gondwana, e o Neopermiano, sob o jugo da Orogenia Sanrafa{\'{e}}lica, foram per{\'{i}}odos em que as taxas de subsid{\^{e}}ncia intracrat{\^{o}}nica cresceram marcadamente.

	Permocarboniferous glacial pavements has already been found in several places in southern Brazil. In the southeast of Parana State there are many occurrences, as the well-known striated surface produced over Devonian basement rocks in the locality of Witmarsun. However, most of the pavements are in fact soft-sediment striated surfaces preserved in the lower part of the glacial Itarare Group itself. At the base of a deglacial sequence exposed in the valley of the Salto River near the Palmeira town, several soft-sand striated surfaces are distributed in four different stratigraphic levels inside cross-stratified sandstones interpreted as deposits of subaqueous outwash fans. Scour marks indicate paleoglacial movement towards the azimuth 341{\textordmasculine}, coherent with the advance of glaciers postulated in regional paleogeographic reconstructions for Permocarboniferous of south Brazil. The surfaces are discontinuous, sometimes slightly concave and associated with linear grooves, and the preservation was favored by thin laminae of fines. These characteristics and the fact that they are not covered by coarse facies like diamictites, allow us to interpret them as soft-sand striated surfaces produced by floating ice. The highly consistent orientation of striations and grooves suggests that they were formed near the grounding zone of an ice shelf in a marine environment, but the surfaces could be ice keel scour marks produced by free-floating ice masses.},

	abstract = {A numerical experiment was applied to explore the potentialities and limitations of joint inversion of IP-affected transients measured with different loop configurations above a uniform half-space with a Cole-Cole complex conductivity. One of us calculated 200 m ?? 50 m and 50 m ?? 50 m loop responses of a uniform polarizable conductor with varied Cole-Cole parameters and imposed synthetic Gaussian noise that simulated measurement errors. Then the generated pseudo-experimental data passed to the other co-author who performed single and joint 1D inversion twice: first being unaware of the "true" underlying models and then after being told that they all were represented by a uniform polarizable earth. More than a half of the fitted models provided a good idea of the true models though misfit was quite large in some cases. The fit was better in single inversion with a priori information available, and improved further through joint inversion of central-loop and coincident-loop responses. Joint inversion with a priori information known was of good quality even at a chargeability as low as 0.02. The standard error in joint inversion was times the measurement error and depended mainly on fitting errors for smaller-loop data. The reason is that the smaller-loop transients included a non-monotonous interval where the signal changed rapidly under the effect of fast-decaying induced polarization. ?? 2008.},

	abstract = {Breakup of the North Atlantic during the early tertiary was accompanied by widespread and massive magmatism, resulting in the coverage of large areas of the North Atlantic with flood basalts. These flood basalts hamper seismic investigations of underlying sequences and thus the understanding of the rifting, subsidence and evolution of the margin which, in turn, increases the risk for hydrocarbon exploration. In this paper we present a methodology for the simultaneous joint inversion of diverse geophysical datasets, i.e. free air gravity and magnetotelluric soundings (MT) using seismic a priori constraints. The attraction of the joint inversion approach is that different geophysical measurements are sensitive to different properties of the sub-surface, so through joint inversion we significantly reduce the null space and produce a single model that fits all datasets within a predefined tolerance. Using sensitivity analysis of synthetic data, we show how each data set contains complementary important information of the supra and sub-basalt structure. While separate inversions of individual datasets fail to image through the basalt layer, our joint inversion approach leads to a much improved sub-basalt structure. Application of the joint inversion algorithm to satellite gravity data and MT data acquired on the FLARE10 seismic line south west of Faroe islands supports the existence of a 1??km to 2??km thick low velocity region that might be indicative of the existence of a sedimentary basin underneath the basalt layer. Though in this paper we demonstrate the use of joint inversion on a sub-basalt target, we believe it has wider applicability to other areas where conventional seismic imaging fails. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The calculated results from various sediment transport formulas often differ from each other and from measured data. Some parameters in the sediment transport formulas are more effective than others to estimate total sediment load. In this study, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model is trained using four dominant parameters of sediment transport formulas. ANN models are able to reveal hidden laws of natural phenomena such as sediment transport process. The results of ANN and some total bed material load sediment transport formulas have been compared to indicate the importance of variables which can be used in developing sediment transport formulas. To train ANN, average flow velocity, water surface slopes, average flow depth, and median particle diameter are used as dominant parameters to estimate total bed material load. Two hundreds and fifty samples are used to train the ANN model. Twenty-four sets of field data not used in the training nor calibration of ANN are used to compare or verify the accuracy of ANN and some well-known total bed material load formulas. The test results show that the ANN model developed in this study using minimum number of dominant factors is a reliable and uncomplicated method to predict total sediment transport rate or total bed material load transport rate. Results show that the accuracy of formulas in descending order are those by Yang (1973), Laursen (1958), Engelund and Hansen (1972), Ackers and White (1973), and Toffaleti (1969). These results are similar to those made by ASCE (1982) based on laboratory and field data not used in this paper. Study results also show that the formulas based on physical laws of sediment transport, like those formulas that were developed based on power concept, are more accurate than other formulas for estimating total bed material sediment load in rivers. ?? 2009 International Research and Training Centre on Erosion and Sedimentation and the World Association for Sedimentation and Erosion Research.},

	abstract = {MATLAB is a high-level matrix/array language with control flow statements and functions. MATLAB has several useful toolboxes to solve complex problems in various fields of science, such as geophysics. In geophysics, the inversion of 2D DC resistivity imaging data is complex due to its non-linearity, especially for high resistivity contrast regions. In this paper, we investigate the applicability of MATLAB to design, train and test a newly developed artificial neural network in inverting 2D DC resistivity imaging data. We used resilient propagation to train the network. The model used to produce synthetic data is a homogeneous medium of 100 ?? m resistivity with an embedded anomalous body of 1000 ?? m. The location of the anomalous body was moved to different positions within the homogeneous model mesh elements. The synthetic data were generated using a finite element forward modeling code by means of the RES2DMOD. The network was trained using 21 datasets and tested on another 16 synthetic datasets, as well as on real field data. In field data acquisition, the cable covers 120 m between the first and the last take-out, with a 3 m x-spacing. Three different electrode spacings were measured, which gave a dataset of 330 data points. The interpreted result shows that the trained network was able to invert 2D electrical resistivity imaging data obtained by a Wenner-Schlumberger configuration rapidly and accurately. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This study focuses on the development of an accurate and efficient method of data integration, processing and generation of a landslide susceptibility map using an ANN and data from ASTER images. The method contains two major phases. The first phase is the data integration and analysis, and the second is the Artificial Neural Network training and mapping. The data integration and analysis phase involve GIS based statistical analysis relating landslide occurrence to geological and DEM (digital elevation model) derived geomorphological parameters. The parameters include slope, aspect, elevation, geology, density of geological boundaries and distance to the boundaries. This phase determines the geological and geomorphological factors that are significantly correlated with landslide occurrence. The second phase further relates the landslide susceptibility index to the important geological and geomorphological parameters identified in the first phase through ANN training. The trained ANN is then used to generate a landslide susceptibility map. Landslide data from the 2004 Niigata earthquake and a DEM derived from ASTER images were used. The area provided enough landslide data to check the efficiency and accuracy of the developed method. Based on the initial results of the experiment, the developed method is more than 90{\%} accurate in determining the probability of landslide occurrence in a particular area. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Time-lapse geophysical monitoring and inversion are valuable tools in hydrogeology for monitoring changes in the subsurface due to natural and forced (tracer) dynamics. However, the resulting models may suffer from insufficient resolution, which leads to underestimated variability and poor mass recovery. Structural joint inversion using cross-gradient constraints can provide higher-resolution models compared with individual inversions and we present the first application to time-lapse data. The results from a synthetic and field vadose zone water tracer injection experiment show that joint 3-D time-lapse inversion of crosshole electrical resistance tomography (ERT) and ground penetrating radar (GPR) traveltime data significantly improve the imaged characteristics of the point injected plume, such as lateral spreading and center of mass, as well as the overall consistency between models. The joint inversion method appears to work well for cases when one hydrological state variable (in this case moisture content) controls the time-lapse response of both geophysical methods.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new methodology to continuously update and improve fracture network models. We begin with a hypothetical model whose fracture network parameters and geological information are known. After generating the "exact" fracture network with known characteristics, the data were exported to a reservoir simulator and simulations were run over a period of time. Intelligent wells equipped with downhole multiple pressure and flow sensors were placed throughout the reservoir and put into production. These producers were completed in different fracture zones to create a representative pressure and production response. We then considered a number of wells of which static (cores and well logs) and dynamic (production) data were used to model well fracture density. As new wells were opened, historical static and dynamic data from previous wells and static data from the new wells were used to update the fracture density using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The accuracy of the prediction model depends significantly on the representation of the available data of the existing fracture network. The importance of conventional data (surface production data) and smart well data prediction capability was also investigated. Highly sensitive input data were selected through a forward selection scheme to train the ANN. Well geometric locations were included as a new link in the ANN regression process. Once the relationship between fracture network parameters and well performance data was established, the ANN model was used to predict fracture density at newly drilled locations. Finally, an error analysis through a correlation coefficient and percentage absolute relative error performance was performed to examine the accuracy of the proposed inverse modeling methodology. It was shown that fracture dominated production performance data collected from both conventional and smart wells allow for automatically updating the fracture network model. The proposed technique helps in generating another - readily available at no cost - data source for fracture characterization as a supplement to limited 1D data obtained from well logs and cores. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {An extensive study of the resistivity structure of the Hengill area in SW Iceland was carried out by the combined use of TEM and MT soundings. Joint inversion of the collected data can correct for static shifts in the MT data, which can be severe due to large near-surface resistivity contrasts. Joint 1D inversion of 148 TEM/MT sounding pairs and a 3D inversion of a 60 sounding subset of the MT data were performed. The 3D inversion was based on full MT impedance tensors previously corrected for static shift. Both inversion approaches gave qualitatively similar results, and revealed a shallow resistivity layer reflecting conductive alteration minerals at temperatures of 100-240 ??C. They also delineated a deep conductor at 3-10 km depth. The reason for this deep-seated high conductivity is not fully understood. The distribution of the deep conductors correlates with a positive residual Bouguer gravity anomaly, and with transform tectonics inferred from seismicity. One model of the Hengill that is consistent with the well temperature data and the deep conductor that does not attenuate S-waves, is a group of hot, solidified, but still ductile magmatic intrusions that are closely associated with the heat source for the geothermal system. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Seismic methods continue to receive interest for use in mineral exploration due to the much higher resolution potential of seismic data compared to the techniques traditionally used, namely, gravity, magnetics, resistivity, and electromagnetics. However, the complicated geology often encountered in hard-rock exploration can make data processing and interpretation difficult. Inverting seismic data jointly with a complementary data set can help overcome these difficulties and facilitate the construction of a common earth model. We considered the joint inversion of seismic first-arrival traveltimes and gravity data to recover causative slowness and density distributions. Our joint inversion algorithm differs from previous work by (1) incorporating a large suite of measures for coupling the two physical property models, (2) slowly increasing the effect of the coupling to help avoid potential convergence issues, and (3) automatically adjusting two Tikhonov tradeoff parameters to achieve a desired fit to both data sets. The coupling measures used are both compositional and structural in nature and allow the inclusion of explicitly known or implicitly assumed empirical relationships, physical property distribution information, and cross-gradient structural coupling. For any particular exploration scenario, the combination of coupling measures used should be guided by the geologic knowledge available. We performed our inversions on unstructured grids comprised of triangular cells in 2D, or tetrahedral cells in 3D, but the joint inversion methods are equally applicable to rectilinear grids. We tested our joint inversion methodology on scenarios based on the Voisey's Bay massive sulfide deposit in Labrador, Canada. These scenarios present a challenge to the inversion of first-arrival traveltimes and we show how joint inversion with gravity data can improve recovery of the subsurface features.},

The results of joint inversion clearly mapped the various units and are a significant improvement over previous models derived from separate 2D seismic reflection processing and 2D magnetotelluric imaging.

Nowadays there are no standard standpoints using the appellation joint inversion. What is joint inversion? Based on the information matrix an answer could be given for this question what could be regarded as various types of data sets that are inverted simultaneously. We would like to expand the explanation—that is professed by many researchers—of the method that regards only the simultaneous inversion of data sets based on different physical parameters as joint inversion.},

Such structures are difficult to image with a single method, and our results demonstrate how combining different techniques can yield improved results. More importantly, we examine the reliability of velocity-conductivity relationships derived from structure-coupled joint inversion approaches. Comparison with a seismic reflection section shows that our models match the upper limit of the salt. Furthermore, velocity and resistivity logs from a borehole drilled into the salt dome's flank match, within error, those recovered by the inversion. The good match suggests that the difference in length scale does not have a significant effect in this case. This provides a strong incentive to incorporate borehole data into the joint inversion in the future and substantiates approaches that use the relationships derived from joint inversion models for lithological classification.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

	abstract = {This article presents a geologic-geophysical model along a 320 km NW – SE profile at the central region of Paran{\'{a}} basin, based primarily on a 2D gravity model, in complement to collocated magnetotelluric (MT) studies that are being carried out by the Brazilian National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels - ANP. The study of large structures within the basement underneath a sedimentary basin is of vital importance for the understanding of its tectonic-stratigraphic evolution. The Paran{\'{a}} basin is a shallow basin with a depocenter reaching approximately 7, 000m of estimated depth. Two large regional structures are remarkable in the study area: the Ponta Grossa Arch, a NW-SE direction feature; and the gravity high of Paranapanema, an elongated NW-SE positive anomaly. The region also includes large lava flows represented by basalt rocks of the Serra Geral Formation. Intrusion of dikes and sills of diabase, dating mainly from the Cretaceous, are equally striking in the region. These intrusions took advantage of certain bygone structural lineament groups to settle. The Bouguer surface of the study area was represented by a 4th degree polynomial, to estimate the depth of Moho. The proposed final gravimetric model includes the regional topography and presents good fit, with rms error of 1.7 mGal. Its shallowest part was obtained by taking into ac- count data from six existing stratigraphic wells in the area and also integrating 1D electrical resistivity model links from new magnetotelluric measured data in regional profile. The deepest structures of the model were connected to studies of deep seismic refraction, receptor function analysis and surface waves‘ dispersion, in particular the depth of the Moho. Tests with synthetic MT models support the proposed geological - geophysical model which present some notable characteristics: the crust – mantle interface is very smooth and oscillates around 42 km deep. The upper crust was represented by two blocks that correspond, in the northwestern portion, to the Precambrian continental crust and Paranapanema and, in the southeastern portion, to a mobile belt, also Precambrian, called Rio Apia{\'{i}}, characterized by positive residual gravity anomaly, in accordance with the tectonic context of the region already described in previous studies. The basin-basement limit, derived from the MT model, revealed a fractured surface with an average depth of 5.5 km. The sedimentary portion can be differentiated in its established super-sequences, but does not resolve the problematic of dikes and sills for the studied profile},

	abstract = {Porosity is one of the most important parameters of the hydrocarbon reservoirs, the accurate knowledge of which allows petroleum engineers to have adequate tools to evaluate and minimize the risk and uncertainty in the exploration and production of oil and gas reservoirs. Different direct and indirect methods are used to measure this parameter, most of which (e.g. core analysis) are very time-consuming as well as cost-consuming. Hence, applying an efficient method that can model this important parameter is of the highest importance. Most of the researches show that the capability (i.e. classification, pattern matching, optimization and data mining) of an ANN is suitable for inherenting uncertainties and imperfections found in petroleum engineering problems considering its successful application. In this paper, an alternative method of porosity prediction, which is based on integration between wavelet theory and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) or wavelet network (wavenet), is presented. In this study, different wavelets are applied as activation functions to predict the porosity from well log data. The efficacy of this type of network in function learning and estimation is compared with ANNs. The simulation results indicate decrease in estimation error values that depicts its ability to enhance the function approximation capability and consequently exhibits excellent learning ability compared to the conventional neural network with sigmoid or other activation functions.},

If one of these parameters is lacking, the estimation of the natural fracture porosity using log data becomes impossible. The problem found in the study area of the Hassi Messaoud oil field is that the transit time is missing in many wells, which makes the calculations of the natural fracture porosity difficult. A methodology is proposed in this paper to estimate this parameter by means of fuzzy ranking and artificial neural network (ANN) using four conventional log data (deep resistivity, density, neutron porosity and gamma ray) from well{\#}1 and well{\#}2 in Hassi Messaoud oil field.Fuzzy ranking is used to rank the log data input with the degree of influence at the desired output of the ANN, the results obtained confirm that all data used by ANN are important and we cannot neglect any one. The structure of the ANN was trained using the back-propagation algorithm, the training was retained when the number of epochs is equal to 1000 and the mean squared error is equal to 0.001. The correlation coefficient (R2) between the natural fracture porosity obtained from ANN and log data is equal to 0.878.The methodology presented in this paper can serve for the prediction of natural fracture porosity from well log data when the transit time or the characteristics of the mud are unknown in the oil wells. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is used to estimate reservoir parameters from well test data. Theoretical pressure derivative curves, generated by the Sthefest numerical Laplace inverse algorithm and belonged to a Naturally Fractured Reservoir (NFR) with Pseudo Steady State (PSS) inetrporosity flow, used to train the ANN. Instead of using normalized pressure derivative data as ANN׳s input, the coefficients of interpolating Chebysehv polynomials on the pressure derivative data in log–log plot were used as input to the ANN. Different training algorithms used to train the ANN and optimum number of neurons for each algorithm were obtained through minimizing Mean Relative Error (MRE) over test data. According to the results of MRE, it is concluded that Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm has the lowest possible MRE among various training algorithms used to train the ANN. In order to compare the accuracy of the new proposed method with the previously used methods, normalized pressure derivative data and coefficients of the conventional polynomials are used to train the ANN. Results show that employing the coefficients of the Chebyshev polynomials as input to ANN׳s decreases MRE over test data while using coefficients of conventional polynomials worsens learning phase of the neural network compared to the normalization method. The lower values of the MRE when using conventional polynomials arise from the fact that interpolating a function using Chebyshev polynomials is more accurate than other interpolation techniques for a specific number of basic functions. Test data are used to verify the accuracy of the trained ANN to estimate each reservoir parameter. Low relative error values of reservoir parameters when using test data shows the capability of the new method which employs the Chebyshev polynomial coefficients as input to train ANN. Moreover, a field data for a dual-porosity fractured reservoir is applied to make a comparison of ANN׳s outputs with the results obtained using different well test softwares and normalization method. The results show a good consistency between ANN and well test softwares.},

	abstract = {Weightless Neural Networks (WNNs) are a powerful mechanism for pattern recognition. Aiming at enhancing their learning capabilities, Multi-valued Probabilistic Logic Nodes (M-PLN) are used, instead of crisp neurons with a 0/1 based RAM-nodes. An M-PLN stores a mapping of, or possibly, the triggering probability, for each input pattern that needs to be recognized. The M-PLN model attempts to strengthen the discrepancies between distinct patterns used during the training process and those that have not yet been processed. In this paper, an efficient yet customizable hardware architecture for M-PLN based neural network is proposed. It implements the learning and operation processes of a pyramidal network structure, augmented by a probabilistic rewarding/punishing search algorithm. The training algorithm can adapt itself to the overall hit ratio so far achieved by the network. Using class-dedicated layers, the hardware is able to handle image classification in parallel and thus, very efficiently. Furthermore, the classification process is performed in a pipelined manner so its stages never stop working until all input images are classified. Nonetheless, during network training, only one of these layers is activated. Last but not least, the architecture is customizable as its structure can be tailored in accordance to the application characteristics in terms of class number, pattern tuple size and image resolution. In order to evaluate the time and cost requirements of the proposed design, its underlying architecture was specified in VHDL and functionally tested. The presented results are two-fold: first, based on many functional simulations, estimated time and cost requirements are analyzed; second, to further assess the performance of the proposed the design, the VHDL model was synthesized to produce a semi-custom implementation on FPGAs. We also give an assessment of the quality of the entailed classification process. The architecture exhibits performance and reconfiguration capabilities that are very promising and encouraging towards the fabrication of a prototype on ASIC.},

	abstract = {The objective of this paper is to study the use of a decision tree$\backslash$nclassifier and multiscale texture measures to extract thematic$\backslash$ninformation on the tropical vegetation cover from the Global Rain Forest$\backslash$nMapping (GRFM) JERS-1 SAR mosaics. The authors focus their study on a$\backslash$ncoastal region of Gabon, which has a variety of land cover types common$\backslash$nto most tropical regions. A decision tree classifier does not assume a$\backslash$nparticular probability density distribution of the input data, and is$\backslash$nthus well adapted for SAR image classification. A total of seven$\backslash$nfeatures, including wavelet-based multiscale texture measures (at scales$\backslash$nof 200, 400, and 800 m) and multiscale multitemporal amplitude data (two$\backslash$ndates at scales 100 and 400 m), are used to discriminate the land cover$\backslash$nclasses of interest. Among these layers, the best features for$\backslash$nseparating classes are found by constructing exploratory decision trees$\backslash$nfrom various feature combinations. The decision tree structure stability$\backslash$nis then investigated by interchanging the role of the training samples$\backslash$nfor decision tree growth and testing. They show that the construction of$\backslash$nexploratory decision trees can improve the classification results. The$\backslash$nanalysis also proves that the radar backscatter amplitude is important$\backslash$nfor separating basic land cover categories such as savannas, forests,$\backslash$nand flooded vegetation. Texture is found to be useful for refining$\backslash$nflooded vegetation classes. Temporal information from SAR images of two$\backslash$ndifferent dates is explicitly used in the decision tree structure to$\backslash$nidentify swamps and temporarily flooded vegetation},

	abstract = {This study integrates log-derived empirical formulas and the concept of the committee machine to develop an improved model for predicting permeability. A set of three empirical formulas, such as the Wyllie-Rose, Coates-Dumanoir, and porosity models to correlate reservoir well-logging information with measured core permeability, are used as expert members in a committee machine. A committee machine, a new type of neural network, has a parallel architecture that fuses knowledge by combining the individual outputs of its experts to arrive at an overall output. In this study, an ensemble-based committee machine with empirical formulas (CMEF) is used. This machine combines three individual formulas, each of which performs the same evaluation task. The overall output of each ensemble member is then computed according to the coefficients (weights) of the ensemble averaging method that reflects the contribution of each formula. The optimal combination of weights for prediction is also investigated using a genetic algorithm. We illustrate the method using a case study. Eighty-two data sets composed of well log data and core data were clustered into 41 training sets to construct the model and 41 testing sets to validate the model's predictive ability. A comparison of prediction results from the CMEF model and from three individual empirical formulas showed that the proposed CMEF model for permeability prediction provided the best generalization and performance for validation. This indicated that the CMEF model was more accurate than any one of the individual empirical formulas performing alone. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {We describe spatiotemporal variation in land cover over 80,000 km2 in central Rond{\^{o}}nia. We use a multistage process to map primary forest, pasture, second growth, urban, rock/savanna, and water using 33 Landsat scenes acquired over three contiguous areas between 1975 and 1999. Accuracy of the 1999 classified maps was assessed as exceeding 85{\%} based on digital airborne videography. Rond{\^{o}}nia is highly fragmented, in which forests outside of restricted areas consist of numerous, small irregular patches. Pastures in Rond{\^{o}}nia persist over many years and are not typically abandoned to second growth, which when present rarely remains unchanged longer than 8 years. Within the state, annual deforestation rates, pasture area, and ratio of second growth to cleared area varied spatially. Highest initial deforestation rates occurred in the southeast (Luiza), at over 2{\%}, increasing to 3{\%} by the late 1990s. In this area, the percentage of cleared land in second growth averaged 18{\%} and few pastures were abandoned. In central Rond{\^{o}}nia (Ji-Paran{\'{a}}), deforestation rates rose from 1.2{\%} between 1978 and 1986 to a high of 4.2{\%} in 1999. In the northwest (Ariquemes), initial deforestation rates were lowest at 0.5{\%} but rose substantially in the late 1990s, peaking at 3{\%} in 1998. The ratio of second growth to cleared area was more than double the ratio in Luiza and few pastures remained unchanged beyond 8 years. Land clearing was most intense close to the major highway, BR364, except in Ariquemes. Intense forest clearing extended at least 50 km along the margins of BR364 in Ji-Paran{\'{a}} and Luiza. Spatial differences in land use are hypothesized to result from a combination of economic factors and soil fertility.},

A decision tree using the C4.5 algorithm was generated to illustrate the influence of geophysical parameters on the formation of tropical cyclone in weighted correlations. From the decision tree, we also induced decision rules to reveal the quantitative regularities and co-effects of [sea surface temperature, vertical wind shear], [atmospheric water vapor, vertical wind shear], [sea surface temperature, atmospheric water vapor, zonal stretching deformation], [sea surface temperature, vertical wind shear, atmospheric water vapor, zonal stretching deformation], and other combinations to tropical cyclone formation.

	abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

This book goes further, bringing in Bayesian data modelling, Monte Carlo methods, variational methods, clustering algorithms, and neural networks. Why unify information theory and machine learning? Because they are two sides of the same coin. In the 1960s, a single eld, cybernetics, was populated by information theorists, computer scientists, and neuroscientists, all studying common problems. Information theory and machine learning still belong together. Brains are the ultimate compression and communication systems.

It is found that the behavior of every net can be described in these terms, with the addition of more complicated logical means for nets containing circles; and that for any logical expression satisfying certain conditions, one can find a net behaving in the fashion it describes. It is shown that many particular choices among possible neurophysiological assumptions are equivalent, in the sense that for every net behaving under one assumption, there exists another net which behaves under the other and gives the same results, although perhaps not in the same time. Various applications of the calculus are discussed.},

In Chapter 2, a brief review of the main alternative approaches to the development of brain models is presented. Chapter 3 considers the physiological and psychological criteria for a suitable model, and attempts to evaluate the empirical evidence which is available on several important issues. Chapter 4 contains basic definitions and some of the notation to be used in later sections are presented. Parts II and III are devoted to a summary of the established theoretical results obtained to date. Part II (Chapters 5 through 14) deals with the theory of three-layer series-coupled perceptrons, on which most work has been done to date. Part III (Chapters 15 through 20) deals with the theory of multi-layer and cross-coupled perceptrons. Part IV is concerned with more speculative models and problems for future analysis. Of necessity, the final chapters become increasingly heuristic in character, as the theory of perceptrons is not yet complete, and new possibilities are continually coming to light. (Author)},

This relation leads to a new network information criterion which is useful for selecting the optimal network model based on a given training set.},

@article{Milani1998,
	abstract = {The geological development of the Parana Basin was influenced by the geodynamics of southwestern Gondwana, a domain continuously affected during almost all the Phanerozoic eon by compressional stresses derived from a persistently active convergent motion between the continental block and the oceanic lithosphere of Panthalassa. The Parana Basin was supported by a cratonic basement since its inception, but had in its neighbourhood evolving collisional belts fringed by foreland basins. Some areas were selected representing the history of subsidence along the foreland domain of southwestern Gondwana during Paleozoic times. The subsidence analysis showed that such foreland basins experienced cycles of accelerated subsidence that coincide in time with the major orogenic phases, that were related to the docking of terranes along the margin of the continent. The computation of average subsidence rates revealed the main subsidence cycles for the region as a whole. Subsidence and sediment accumulation in the Parana Basin started during Middle to Late Ordovician times when the Precordillera terrane collided against Gondwana and produced the different contractional phases of the Ocloyic Orogeny. The intraplate response to the compressional stresses related to this orogenic cycle was transtensional reactivation of weakness zones, providing the initial subsidence for the Parana Basin. Repeatedly during the geologic history of the Parana Basin orogenic cycles left their signature as periods of accelerated subsidence. Subsidence plots revealed that Early Devonian times, when the stresses generated by the Precordilleran Orogeny affected Gondwana, and Late Permian times, under the yoke of the Sanrafaelic Orogeny, were periods when intracratonic subsidence rates increased remarkably. An integrated analysis of the sedimentary record of the Parana Basin, considering eustatic variations of the sea level and subsidence cycles of southwestern Gondwana led to the conclusion that the stratigraphic cyclicity observed in the Parana Basin was ultimately influenced by its subsidence history. The presumed global correlation peaks shown in Vail's curve, of Late Silurian, Early Carboniferous and Early Permian ages, are not present in the Parana Basin. Instead, local maximum flooding levels developed in each one of the second order transgressive cycles, during Early Silurian, Early Devonian and Late Permian times, defining the particular subsidence history of this interior basin as an intraplate response to geodynamic processes affecting southwestern Gondwana margin.},

In the thermomechanical study, 81 exploratory boreholes for hydrocarbon tolled by PETROBRAS and PAULIPETRO were used, applying pure shear extensional models. With this modeling, it was possible to locate a region of greatest stress, between 23,8 S, 53,8 W and 22,3 S, 52,0 W -which could reflect the existence of a paleo-structure representing the boundary between tectonic blocks. The results obtained, associated with the types of sedimentation described for the principal chronostratigraphic sequences, are also discussed.},

	abstract = {Delineation of bed boundaries is one of the important aspects of petrophysical interpretation. Proper location of bed boundaries plays a key role in log data inversion, especially in resistivity inversion, where the subsurface formation parameters are commonly parameterized into layers of varying thickness and resistivity. Traditionally, the location of bed boundaries is chosen based on the inflection points, maximum change in slope, etc. These algorithms work well for focussed responses and reasonably well for unfocussed responses, but the algorithms fail in presence of noise and in thin-bed regions. In order to overcome these difficulties, we propose an algorithm using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for detection of bed boundaries. We demonstrate the applicability of the algorithm on array induction data for a synthetic Oklahoma formation model and a field data from the Gulf of Mexico. The results obtained from the proposed scheme are compared with existing bed boundary algorithms},

@article{Benaouda1999,
	abstract = {In boreholes with partial or no core recovery, interpretations of lithology in the remainder of the hole are routinely attempted using data from downhole geophysical sensors. We present a practical neural net-based technique that greatly enhances lithological interpretation in holes with partial core recovery by using downhole data to train classifiers to give a global classification scheme for those parts of the borehole for which no core was retrieved. We describe the system and its underlying methods of data exploration, selection and classification, and present a typical example of the system in use. Although the technique is equally applicable to oil industry boreholes, we apply it here to an Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) borehole (Hole 792E, Izu-Bonin forearc, a mixture of volcaniclastic sandstones, conglomerates and claystones). The quantitative benefits of quality-control measures and different subsampling strategies are shown. Direct comparisons between a number of discriminant analysis methods and the use of neural networks with back-propagation of error are presented. The neural networks perform better than the discriminant analysis techniques both in terms of performance rates with test data sets (2–3 per cent better) and in qualitative correlation with non-depth-matched core. We illustrate with the Hole 792E data how vital it is to have a system that permits the number and membership of training classes to be changed as analysis proceeds. The initial classification for Hole 792E evolved from a five-class to a three-class and then to a four-class scheme with resultant classification performance rates for the back-propagation neural network method of 83, 84 and 93 per cent respectively.},

	abstract = {The set of geological elements that control the petroleum existence and distribution in the sedimentary basins are integrated under the concept of petroleum systems. Such a concept seems to adequately justify the known petroleum provinces worldwide. The Mesozoic-Cenozoic tectono-sedimentary evolution of the Brazilian margin provided the key elements for petroleum existence. In the present day view, the deep water domain of the Campos Basin appears as the area where petroleum systems worked in a very favourable manner, being the region that presently holds most of Brazilian oil and gas reserves. The history of petroleum exploration in Brazil includes three major phases: the pre-Petrobras phase, characterized by pioneer recognition activities; the Petrobras period, when the Company worked under the monopoly regime, including the following sub-phases – 1954/1968: exploration in land, 1969/1974: shallow water activities; 1975/1984: shallow water in Campos Basin; and 1985/1997: deep water exploration; each one of these sub-phases had very peculiar characteristics, and the Brazilian petroleum reserves increased progressively during the entire phase, reaching today the amount of 16 billion barrels of oil-equivalent. Today, the Country is living under the New Regulation of the Petroleum Sector; new players came into the game, re-exploring older provinces and reaching brand new, challenging frontiers.},
